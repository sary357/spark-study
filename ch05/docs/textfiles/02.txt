Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made a surprise visit to troops fighting in one of the most fiercely contested parts of the eastern Donetsk region: the ruined city of Avdiivka.

Video released by the Ukrainian Presidency showed Zelensky standing on a muddy track with the town’s name behind him. Two detonations can be heard in the distance as the president speaks. He is also shown presenting medals to troops in an underground bunker.

"Ukraine is defending its own here. Defending our entire nation. Just as on the entire front line," Zelensky said.
"It is hard. It is pain and losses. And these are the people who keep Ukraine alive," the president continued. "Life is being fought for here."

Zelensky said his team "extended Christmas and New Year greetings to the military" and shared his "immense gratitude to all the relatives, to every family of our heroes."

Some background: Avdiivka has been subjected to relentless Russian attacks in recent weeks.

Earlier this week, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces warned that Russia could concentrate its forces such that Avdiivka "will have the same fate as Bakhmut," referring to the long-contested eastern city that Russia claimed to finally seize last spring.

Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi added that, depending on how the battle for Avdiivka develops, the Ukrainian military would assess whether to withdraw from the town in order to save soldiers' lives. 

Earlier this month, Zelensky called the fighting in Avdiivka an “onslaught” and said the battle could in many ways “determine the overall course of the war.”
